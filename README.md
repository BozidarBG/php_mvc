Hello :)

This app is made using my mini PHP MVC framework. App itself is not so big but mini framework has lots of features that could be used in various applications.

I am not proffesional developer yet so this framework so far, it is just for the purpose of practising PHP and JavaScript.


Framework has the following features: 
- PDO connection to DB
- Query builder methods
- Cookies
- Authentication system
  - with optional email confirmation with token verification
  - with remember me token set in the cookie
- CSFR protection
- Encryption
- File handling 
- Session 
- Email
- Logging
- Custom form validation on frontend in vanilla JS
- Custom form validation on backend
- Middlewares
- Router
- Relationships one to one, one to many and many to many

Application itself is build on theme I took from https://www.free-css.com and admin area is using Material Dashboard https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard.

Administrator can:
- CRUD courses and teachers
- Receive inquiries
- Receive applications for courses
- Delete users
- Change app settings

Authenticated users can:
- Apply for courses
- See list and prices of courses they applied for
- Change password

Cheers,
